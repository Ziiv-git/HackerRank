'''Objective
Today weâ€™re discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials
and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as	a-b	.
The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers,
elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in elements.
The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer
array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer
(MaximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it
to the elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any
2 numbers in N and stores it in the MaximumDifference instance variable.
Input Format
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution
class in your editor reads in 2 lines of input; the first line contains N, and
the second line describes the elements array.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 10
1 <= elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N-1
Output Format
You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print
the value of the MaximumDifference instance variable.
